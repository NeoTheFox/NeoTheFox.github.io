Yes. As simple as that - whatever you do with your PC it is a great thing to have. Now I am not saying you should go and get one right now - they are pricey, and I would never say you NEED one, even if you are a professional. Sure thing there are absolute worst membrane keyboards out there - I remember having one, and if you are trying to touch type with one of these - you are not going to do very well at all. But all you have to do is get yourself a decent membrane keyboard, with X key attachment, and you would be golden.

There are some models with objectively worse or better ergonomics and layouts, but here is the catch - most of the mechanical keyboards worth buying comes with different switches. And there are lots of switches, and they all just different.

Most popular ones are made by Cherry corporation and called Cherry MX, and there are Gateron switches that mimic Cherry switches almost identically. Cherry switches are distinguished by color - you can get Cherry MX Blue,  Cherry MX Brown, etc.
What makes them different? The feeling. There are 3 sides to any switch - click, bump, and pressure (also known as actuation weight),

Click is the sound switch makes when being pressed, it is also important that click should be emitted exactly at the point  where keypress is registered - click helps you to know when the keypress happened by an audible click. As simple as that. Click is also something symbolic for mechanical keyboards, and the major annoyance to whoever is close to you when you are typing. 

The bump is like a sensible limit you can feel o
